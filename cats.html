        <h1>Why I Love My Cats</h1>
        <aside>
        <h2>Prelude to my association with cats</h2>
        <p>I have never had a pet cat when I was growing up.  I and my brother 
		have had pet fish, parakeets, lizards, dogs and even had a couple white mice
		untill our aunt walked into the room, saw my brother Mike handling the
		mice and screamed bloody murder.  Our mother made us take the mice back 
		to the pet shop where I had bought them with money made by picking up 
		discarded soda bottles and refunding them at the mom and pop store round
		the corner from our house.  I did not get my pop bottle money refunded to
		me for returning the mice.</p>
		<p>The first cat ever allowed to stay in our home was a sweet black and
		white stray that Mike brought home from the Park.  Sweet Cat had a litter
		of 4 kittens up inside our mothers couch a few days after entering our
		home.  Mike found homes for Momma and her kittens and got to keep one
		kitten which he named Spike.</p>

        <h2>Stray Cat</h2>
        <pre class="poem">
        by Francis Whitman

        Oh, what unhappy twist of fate
        Has brought you homeless to my gate?
        The gate where once another stood
        To beg for shelter, warmth, and food
        For from that day I ceased to be
        The master of my destiny.
        While he, with purr and velvet paw
        Became within my house the law.
        He scratched the furniture and shed
        And claimed the middle of my bed.
        He ruled in arrogance and pride
        And broke my heart the day he died.
        So if you really think, oh Cat,
        I'd willingly relive all that
        Because you come forlorn and thin
        Well...don't just stand there...Come on in!
