    <p>is an ethnic town.  After WWII, black folks and white folks made the migration North in search of jobs.  James family came from Alabama.  My family came from West Virginia.  We lived in a 2 bedroom apartment at first.  Uncles and aunts came to stay with us and at one time 4 uncles lived with us.  I went by the house we lived in and I don't remember it being so small.  I remember a lot of jokes about hillbillies.  In particular, people used to joke about seeing the long line of car lights every Friday as folks headed south to West Virginia and Kentucky.  It was true, because, when my father got off work on Friday he came home picked us up and off we went to my Grandparents.  It was an 8 hour drive in the days before Intrstates were built. We would be back in Cleveland on Sunday night.</p>
    <p>Today, there are folks from everywhere on the globe living here.  Lots of folks from Europe, the former Soviet Republics in North Asia, Africa, South Asia, South-East Asia, and the Americas live here.</p>
